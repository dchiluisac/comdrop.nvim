*comdrop.txt*    For Neovim version 0.5                  Last change: 2022 Dec 27
==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION                                     *comdrop* *compdrop-introduction*

Comdrop is a plugin allowing you to simple and fast access to commands set by 
you as well as commands defined by other plugins in neovim.
Just press a key and find the command you need.

==============================================================================
REQUIREMENTS                                              *comdrop-requirements*

Comdrop works only with Neovim and was written with Neovim-0.5, so it is highly
recommended to use Neovim version 0.5+.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                            *comdrop-usage*

Before doing anything else, you have to setup the plugin. 
You need to call the |comdrop.setup| function to correctly initialize the plugin.

For a minimal setup:

    For people using init.lua~
        In your `init.lua`, add:
>
            require('comdrop').setup()
<
    For people using init.vim~
        In your `init.vim`, add:
>
            lua << EOF
            require('comdrop').setup()
            EOF
<
You can pass an optional argument to `setup(opts)` in order to pass {opts}.
Have a look at |comdrop.setup| for further details.

Commands~

You can try this command by typing it in your command line. 
By default, they will use the default options, if you want to customize how 
those commands work, have a look at |comdrop.setup|

`:ComDrop`                                                           *:ComDrop*
    

`comdrop.setup(`{opts}`)`                                         *comdrop.setup*
    Setup the library with options.

    This function will setup the Lua API and commands in a way that respects
    the options you pass. It is mandatory to call that function at some time
    if you want to be able to use Comdrop.

    Arguments:~
        {opts}  List of options. See the |comdrop-config| section.

    * listCommands {list}: this function expects a list of custom commands, 
    these will  be added to the system commands. If you want to keep only
    custom commands, you can set the systemCommands property to false.
    * systemCommands {bool}: listfjsdjf disable command list from vim and 
    other plugins and only custom commands can be displayed
